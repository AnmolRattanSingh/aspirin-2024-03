# Reflection

I feel that the functional way tends to be shorter and easier to read since you don't have to work through if statements, booleans, or loops. But if you don't know any of the functions used in the functional way, you will have to spend time reading the documentation. Perhaps if you have been using the language for a while, you will be familiar with most of the standard ones and will be able to deduce new functions faster as well. Using functional methods also kinda feels like cheating since I don't see exactly what's happening.
